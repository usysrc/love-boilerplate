# Love-boilerplate

boilerplate code from various sources for [LÃ¶ve](http://www.love2d.org) with typical stuff needed for game jams like [ludum dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/)

Uses the following:

- [hump](https://github.com/vrld/hump) for vectors, gamestates, timers, tweens
- [SLAM](https://github.com/vrld/Stuff/tree/master/slam) for better sound control
- Proxies: on demand resource loading
